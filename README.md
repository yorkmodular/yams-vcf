My take on the MS20 voltage-controlled filter - if you want squally, resonant acid sounds then this may well be right up your alley.

Built around an LM13700 transconductance amplifier, this filter uses a pair of red LEDs in the feedback path (rather than the string
of diodes in the original Korg design) to make things a little more ... interesting, but other than that it's a straight-up lifting of 
the classic MS20 design.

Has both low-pass and high-pass inputs, which should be pretty self-explanatory and there's nothing at all to stop you using them both 
together (hilarity often ensues here, since you'll get a really screwed-up bandpass-style response).
